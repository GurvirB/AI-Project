# Predictive Aircraft Maintenance
## Introduction:
This project has been done in fulfillment to the CS595a - Artificial Intelligence course requirement. The aim of the project is to predictive the remaining useful life (RUL) of an engine at any instance of its lifetime using the concepts of Artificial Intelligence, particularly neural networks.

## Problem:
Every year the aviation industry incurs huge costs due to unscheduled or unplanned maintenances of their aircrafts. Costs are both direct (i.e. plane loss,after damage repair,life and personal loss, legal costs) and indirect (i.e. customer disatisfaction, reputation damage). Therefore, the avaition companies are always looking for a solution where they can predict a fault in their planes before it happens,
which leads to the concept of predictive maintenance.
The hundreds of the sensors used in the airplanes produce sufficiently large amounts of data, which can be read and analyzed to see and predict when an engine can be expected to fail. The same approach has been used for the completion of this project.
